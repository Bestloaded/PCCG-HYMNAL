            So many talents wasted! So few bright laurels won!

            And then the peace so lasting— Celestial peace indeed.

            For angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings.
        </chorus>
        <verse>But I hear another anthem blending voices clear and strong,**
            “Unto Him that hath redeemed us and has bought us,” is the song;**
            We have come through tribulations to this land so fair and bright,**
            In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white.

        <verse>Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join that song,**
            Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood–washed throng,**
            For they sing about great trials, battles fought and victories won,**

        </verse>
        <verse>So although I'm not an angel, yet I know that over there,**

            Freely pardoned my transgressions, died to set a sinner free.

            Should I too linger, and with you perish?
        </verse>
        <verse>Farewell, drear earth, by sin so blighted,**
            In immortal beauty soon you'll be arrayed;**
            He who has formed thee will soon restore thee,**
            And then the dread curse shall nevermore be.

            And someday I'll sing with the angels above.

        <title>The Old-Fashioned Meeting</title>
        <verse>Oh how well I remember in the old-fashioned days,**
            When some old fashioned people had some old-fashioned ways;**
            In the old-fashioned meetings as they tarried there,**
            In the old-fashioned manner, how God answered their prayer
        </verse>
        <chorus>‘Twas an old-fashioned meeting in an old fashioned place,**
            Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace:**
            As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray,**
            And God heard me and saved me in the old-fashioned way.
        </chorus>
        <verse>There was singing, such singing, of those old-fashioned airs!**
            There was power, such power in those old-fashioned prayers,**
            An old-fashioned conviction made the sinner pray,**
            And the Lord heard and saved him in the old-fashioned way.
        </verse>
        <verse>Well they say it is better, “things have changed, don't you know?”**
            And the people in general seem to think it is so;**
            And they call me old-fashioned when I dare to say,**
            That I like it far better in the old-fashioned way.
        </verse>
        <verse>If the Lord never changes as the fashions of men,**
            If He's always the same, why, He is old-fashioned then!**
            As an old-fashioned sinner saved through old-time grace,**
            Oh I'm sure He will take me to an old-fashioned place.

        <title>The Holy City</title>
        <verse>Last night I lay a' sleeping, there came a dream so fair,**
            I stood in old Jerusalem beside the temple there.**
            I heard the children singing and ever as they sang,**
            Methought the voice of angels from heaven in answer rang (rep)**
            Jerusalem, Jerusalem, lift up your gates and sing,**
            Hosannah in the highest, Hosannah to your King.
        </verse>
        <chorus/>
        <verse>And then methought my dream was changed**
            the streets no longer rang,**
            Hushed were the glad hosannahs the little children sang,**
            The sun grew dark with mystery, the morn was cold and chill**
            As the shadow of a cross arose upon a lonely hill (rep)**
            Jerusalem, Jerusalem, hark how the angels sing!**
            Hosannah, in the highest, Hosannah to your King.
        </verse>
        <verse>And once again the scene was changed**
            New Earth there seemed to be,**
            I saw the Holy City beside the tideless sea.**
            The light of God was on its streets, the gates were open wide**
            And all who would might enter and no one was denied.**
            They need no moon and stars by night, no sun to rule by day**
            It was the New Jerusalem that would not pass away (rep)**
            Jerusalem, Jerusalem, sing for thy night is o'er,**
            Hosannah in the highest, Hosannah forevermore.

        <title>Never The Same</title>
        <verse>I remember how He waited, how he called me by night,**
            Yet I chose to wander my own way, and nothing worked out right.**
            Till the day I finally surrendered, Jesus healed my life,**
            And I wont be the same, no never the same again..
        </verse>
        <chorus>Never the same again, no, I know I won't be the same again,**
            From the moment I met Jesus, new life for me began,**
            And I won't be the same again.
        </chorus>
        <verse>He may take me through the valley, even though I am His child,**
            And the road He shows me may be rough, and rugged for a while,**
            Yet He takes my hand and speaks the word that lightens up the way,**
            And I wont be the same, no never the same again.

        <title>I Love Him Too Much</title>
        <verse>When I first heard of Jesus, His love and His grace,**
            My heart was overwhelmed, to think a king could take my place,**
            So I cried “I'll go with you every step of the way,”**
            That's all I could do, my debt to repay.
        </verse>
        <chorus>I love Him too much to fail Him now,**
            Too much, to break my vow.**
            For I promised the Lord that I would make it some how,**
            And now I love Him too much to fail Him now.
        </chorus>
        <verse>When I told Him I loved Him, it was easy to say,**
            But harder to prove when temptations came my way,**
            But what good are broken promises, I count them but loss,**
            When I catch a glimpse of true love hanging on a rugged cross.
        </verse>
        <verse>The years have drawn us closer, my love for Him has grown.**
            Each step has drawn me closer, to my eternal home,**
            And I'm just too close to heaven, to turn back now,**
            His grace will be sufficient, I'm gonna make it somehow.

            I dreamed that the nations had gathered**
            To judgment before the white throne.**
            From the throne came a bright shining angel,**
            And stood on the land and the sea,**
            And swore with his hands raised to heaven,**
            That time was no longer to be.

            Had melted and vanished away.**
            A pauper he stood in the judgment,**
            His debts were too heavy to pay,**
            The great man was there, but his greatness,**
            When death came was left far behind,**
            the angel who opened the record,**
            not a trace of his greatness could find.

            I fain would take my stand,**
            The shadow of a mighty rock**
            Within a weary land;**
            A home within the wilderness,**
            A rest upon the way,**
            From the burning of the noon-tide heat,**
            And the burden of the day.

            Who suffered there for me;**
            And from my smitten heart with tears**
            Two wonders I confess:**
            The wonders of redeeming love**
            And my unworthiness.
        </verse>
        <verse>I take O cross, thy shadow**
            For my abiding place;**
            I ask no other sunshine of His face;**
            Content to let the world go by**
            To know no gain nor loss,**
            My sinful self my only shame,**
            My glory all the cross.
